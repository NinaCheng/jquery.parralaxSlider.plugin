						<h2 class="reason-title">Failure to upsell or resell to past customers.</h2>

						<p>
							<span>Are your franchisees leaving money on the table by ignoring the revenue potential from past customers?</span><br>
							If your system for tracking customer info is paper-based or a series of excel sheets, there’s likely a huge opportunity you are missing out on. Plus it’s far easier and cheaper to sell more to your current customers than it is to find and convert completely new customers.
